# Eight Sleep Daemon Scheduler

The `clim8 daemon` command runs a background scheduler that automatically controls your Eight Sleep Pod based on a configured schedule.

## Configuration

Create a config file at `~/.config/clim8/config.yaml` with your schedule:

```yaml
# Your Eight Sleep credentials
email: "your-email@example.com"
password: "your-password"

# Schedule configuration
schedule:
  # Turn on the pod at 10:00 PM
  - time: "22:00"
    action: "on"
  
  # Set temperature to 68°F at 10:15 PM
  - time: "22:15"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "68F"
  
  # Lower temperature for deeper sleep at 1:00 AM
  - time: "01:00"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "65F"
  
  # Slightly warm up before wake time at 5:30 AM
  - time: "05:30"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "70F"
  
  # Turn off the pod at 6:00 AM
  - time: "06:00"
    action: "off"

# Optional: Enable verbose logging
verbose: false
```

## Available Actions

- **`on`** - Turn on the Eight Sleep pod
- **`off`** - Turn off the Eight Sleep pod  
- **`temp`** - Set temperature (requires `temperature` field with F or C suffix)

## Time Format

Times must be in 24-hour format (HH:MM):
- `"09:00"` - 9:00 AM
- `"22:30"` - 10:30 PM
- `"01:15"` - 1:15 AM

## Temperature Format

Temperatures must include the unit suffix:
- `"68F"` - 68 degrees Fahrenheit
- `"24C"` - 24 degrees Celsius
- `"72F"` - 72 degrees Fahrenheit

## Usage

### Run the daemon
```bash
clim8 daemon
```

### Test your schedule (dry run)
```bash
clim8 daemon --dry-run
```

### Run with verbose logging
```bash
clim8 daemon --verbose
```

### Run with custom timezone
```bash
clim8 daemon --timezone "America/Los_Angeles"
```

### Run in background (macOS/Linux)
```bash
nohup clim8 daemon > ~/clim8.log 2>&1 &
```

## Features

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Each scheduled action only runs once per day
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Responds to SIGINT/SIGTERM signals
- **Error Recovery**: Continues running even if individual actions fail
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test your schedule without executing actions
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows what actions are being executed and when
- **Single Instance**: Prevents multiple daemons from running simultaneously
- **Security Checks**: Warns if config file has insecure permissions

## Security Considerations

### Config File Permissions
The daemon checks that your config file has secure permissions and warns if it's readable by others:

```bash
# Secure your config file
chmod 600 ~/.config/clim8/config.yaml
```

### Credential Storage
Your Eight Sleep credentials are stored in plaintext in the config file. Consider:
- Setting restrictive file permissions (600)
- Using environment variables instead:
  ```bash
  export CLIM8_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
  export CLIM8_PASSWORD="your-password"
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Environment variables won't work when ran as a `brew service`

### Process Management
The daemon creates a PID file to prevent multiple instances:
- PID file location: `~/.config/clim8/daemon.pid`
- Automatically cleaned up on shutdown

## Example Sleep Schedule

Here's a complete example for optimized sleep:

```yaml
email: "your-email@example.com"
password: "your-password"

schedule:
  # Pre-bedtime routine
  - time: "21:30"
    action: "on"
  - time: "21:45"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "70F"   # Slightly warm for getting into bed
    
  # Sleep onset
  - time: "22:30"
    action: "temp" 
    temperature: "68F"   # Optimal sleep temperature
    
  # Deep sleep phase
  - time: "00:00"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "65F"   # Cooler for deep sleep
    
  # REM sleep phase  
  - time: "03:00"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "67F"   # Slightly warmer for REM
    
  # Pre-wake warming
  - time: "06:00"
    action: "temp"
    temperature: "72F"   # Warm up to ease waking
    
  # Wake time
  - time: "07:00"
    action: "off"        # Turn off after wake up
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check if daemon is running
```bash
ps aux | grep clim8
```

### View daemon logs (if running in background)
```bash
tail -f ~/clim8.log
```

### Test configuration
```bash
clim8 daemon --dry-run --verbose
```

### Common Issues

1. **No schedule items found**: Check your config file path and YAML syntax
2. **Authentication failed**: Verify your email and password in the config
3. **Actions not executing**: Ensure times are in correct format and check system time
4. **Permission denied**: Make sure config file is readable by the user running the daemon
